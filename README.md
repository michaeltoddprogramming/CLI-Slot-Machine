# CLI SLOT MACHINE IN PYTHON ðŸŽ°
    This program simulates a basic slot machine game where players can spin the reels and potentially win big payouts ðŸ˜Ž
    I did this because I myself do enjoy gambling......Somtimes.....

# How to Play

    Upon running the program, you will be presented with a chance to deposit a balance amount.

    You will be prompted to enter the amount of lines you would like to play.

    You will be prompted to enter the amount you want to bet on each spin.

    The program will randomly generate three symbols for each reel.

    If you get a winning combination, you will earn a prize based on a set multiplyier for each symbol. ( As of right now, only a match of symbols horizontally results in a payout )

    Your balance will be updated accordingly, and you can continue to spin the reels ( ENTER ) or choose to quit the game ( q ).
